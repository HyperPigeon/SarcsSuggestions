# SarcsSuggestions
Sarc's Suggestions is based on a video made by SimplySarc that comes up with uses for "useless" features in Minecraft such as the Wandering Trader, Llamas, Bats, Poisonous Potatoes, and more!

# What new functionality does this mod add?

- Poisonous Potatoes are now plantable and can be used to craft herbicides, which can be used to clear grass, mycelium, and leaf blocks.
     
- All mobs can now ride on llamas (with the exception of other llamas and the wandering trader)

- Heavy weighted pressure plates output a redstone signal proportional to the max health of the entity standing on top of it.
 
- Livestock animals (cows, chickens, sheep, and pigs) will be paralyzed with fear when in the presence of a polar bear.
    
- Despawned tools and armor have a chance of showing up in the wandering trader's trade offers.
    
- Feeding a bat a spider eye will teleport you to your current respawn point.
